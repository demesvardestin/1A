                hey there, thanks for checking out my blog! i'm a self-taught
                software developer and current event enthusiast.
                i'm usually fascinated by sports, politics, home renovations,
                technical research, some topics of philosophy, thelogy and religion
                (personal and organized), as well as medical and scientific
                research that aim to improve humankind on a macro level. in my
                spare time, i usually read, exercise, eat, or build websites (such as
                mine!).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                i currently work in healthcare at one of the largest nyc hospitals
                by size and impact, and in past lives, i worked at an ecommerce
                startup, an aol media subsidiary, a nyc nonprofit, as well as a
                web design consultancy. i currently partner with small nyc
                startups to develop prototypes and mvp's (minimum viable products)
                in my spare time. if you like my <a href="http://demesvar.com/freelance">work</a>,
